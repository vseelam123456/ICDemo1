I want to build a app that...

you can download on your phone and from it you can order products you find in a store directly to your location. This will have a UI similiar to Amazon but instead of taking a few days to deliver to your home it will use a drone delivery system to get you products in under 10min to wherever you are located. This service can also be used with your favorite restraunts so instead of driving all the way to Cipotlle to get a burrito you can order one through the app from the comfort of your home and recieve it in half the time.
